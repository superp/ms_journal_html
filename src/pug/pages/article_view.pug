            h3 Introduction
            p A space that can be seen between the implant surface and surrounding bone upon the immediate implant placement is called a gap (synonyms: jumping distance, bone gap) [1, 2]. A gap (Mehta and Shah, 2015) can occur on any aspect of an immediately placed dental implant: buccal, lingual or proximally [1]. To avoid soft tissues recession in aesthetic zone of anterior maxilla is extremely important to preserve buccal plate in the rehabilitation of patients [3-6]. Because of thin buccal plate in that zone we should pay attention to the plate preservation, as buccal plate resorption is a main reason of soft tissue recession [1, 4]. The purpose of that report is to highlight the technique of immediate implant placement achieving 2.0 mm distance between implant and buccal plate surfaces that allow to obtain a spontaneous bone healing and to preserve buccal plate what reduces a risk of soft tissues recession [7-12].

            h3 Case Presentation
            p A 32-year-old lady referred to the clinic with complaints for symptoms of chronic periapical lesion of a tooth #12. A surgery was performed under local anesthesia (1.7 ml Ultracain D-S forte, Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). After atraumatic removal of a tooth #12 a 10 mm implant (U-Impl, Biel, Switzerland) with 3.5 mm platform was placed more palatally and distally related to the extraction socket (Fig 1). It was chosen a 10 mm implant length with a purpose of possible changing for a longer implant in future in case of re-implantation. The 5.5 mm × 2.0 mm healing abutment (W2, U-Impl, Biel, Switzerland) was used. Sutures: 4-0 coated VICRYL (Ethicon, USA). That type of technique (according to recommendation of Neves et al, 2013 [6]) allowed achieving a spontaneous bone healing and osseointegration of implant with a 2.0 mm gap (Fig 2)

            p statements regarding buccal plate preservation and indications for gap filling [6, 7]: External resorption (modeling) of the socket walls occurs during bone healing. There is spontaneous bone healing and osseointegration of implants with a horizontal defect dimension of 2 mm or less. Bone regeneration procedures are recommended when there is a horizontal defect dimension larger than 2 mm and/or nonintact socket walls  Chen and Buser (2009) accentuated on a recommendation: when the gap is greater than 2 mm, bone gap filling is indicated [8].
